                            <p class="font-18 SofiaPro-Medium">The NHS National Tariff</p>
                            <p class="mb-0 col-grey p-secondary">A national standard price for healthcare
                                procedures. This aimed to create a level playing field for all providers of NHS
                                services, regardless of their status as a public or private sector organisation.
                                This means that if you choose to have your NHS
                                funded treatment at a private hospital the NHS will pay them the NHS National
                                Tariff to perform your treatment. You pay
                                nothing. If you choose to pay the private hospital yourself or your treatment is
                                funded by your healthcare insurer, you are
                                likely to find you will have your treatment performed even quicker.</p>

                    <h2 class="font-28 ">The Act</h2>
                    <p class="col-grey p-secondary">The Act also introduced a number of other important
                        policies, whilst creating bodies and structures to
                        authorise, monitor and regulate all primary care
                        providers (GPs) and secondary care providers (public
                        and private sector hospitals) in England. The Secretary of
                        State for Health, NHS England and other bodies oversee
                        this regime and every healthcare provider needs to be
                        registered with the Care Quality Commission (CQC).
                        Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland have different rules
                        under which NHS care is provided.</p>
                    <p class="col-grey p-secondary">Under the rules in England, GPs are required to notify
                        patients when they have a choice of provider and inform
                        them where they can find information about the choices
                        they have.</p>
                    <p class="col-grey p-secondary">Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs) were created in
                        England to oversee the provision of healthcare in
                        designated regions (authorised by NHS England). CCGs
                        are obliged to consider patient choice and use providers
                        best suited to offer value for money, quality and
                        effciency of healthcare services, whether sourced from
                        the public or private sector using the NHS Tariff. This is
                        designed to create a level playing field for NHS Hospitals
                        and private Hospitals performing NHS work at the NHS
                        Tariff.</p>
                    <p class="col-grey p-secondary">The Act says that paid-for NHS Healthcare services must
                        be in accordance with the NHS Tariff, which is published
                        by NHS Improvement, an organisation that promotes,
                        oversees, and regulates competition in health care
                        services in England.</p>
                    <p class="col-grey p-secondary">In summary, licensed healthcare providers are obliged to
                        promote choice, and they cannot be prejudiced to public
                        or private providers so that nobody gets an unfair
                        advantage in competing with others, whether public or
                        private sector.</p>
                    <p class="col-grey p-secondary">These rights are reflected in the NHS Constitution and the
                        regulations that support it.</p>
